## üí´ About Me:<br>
üî≠ **Currently Working On:** I am dedicated to refining my skills in Deep Learning and Big Data Analytics, focusing on practical applications and project implementations as a Master of Science student at New York University. Currently, I am engaged in several academic projects, including semantic segmentation using U-Net and image classification with custom-built neural networks.<br><br>ü§ù **Looking to Collaborate On:** Eager to partner on cutting-edge projects that leverage Machine Learning and Data Science, especially those that involve innovative uses of semantic segmentation for satellite imagery or advanced image classification techniques. I aim to combine my academic knowledge with real-world applications to solve complex problems.<br><br>üå± **Currently Learning:** Deepening my expertise in Advanced Analytics, Machine Learning, and Data Science. I am committed to mastering these areas to enhance my problem-solving skills and contribute more effectively to my projects, aiming to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical implementation.<br><br>üí¨ **Ask Me About:** Dive into discussions on my project involving Image Classification using ResNet, where I developed a custom ResNet-24 model from scratch for CIFAR-10, achieving a top ranking on Kaggle with 97.3% accuracy. Also, explore my work on analyzing the spread of political fake news with Llama 3, where I fine-tuned models for enhanced detection accuracy and analyzed over 1.7 million tweets for misinformation patterns. These projects reflect my ability to apply complex AI techniques to real-world data challenges.<br><br>‚ö° **Fun Fact:** I make movies. I am a screenplay writer, Editor and a Director. I am making one right now. We can chat about it as well!<br>---
